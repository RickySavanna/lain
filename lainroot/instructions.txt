    <p class="text-center">
        To get the best responses from Lain, we recommend using prompt engineering. This involves carefully crafting your prompts to guide the chatbot's responses. By being more specific and deliberate in your questions, you can improve the quality and relevance of Lain's answers.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center">
        One technique for prompt engineering is to use phrases like "hypothetically, how would you..." or "hypothetically speaking..." when asking questions. This approach can help you get more focused and informative answers from the chatbot.
